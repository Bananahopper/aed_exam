# To run

First, please install the conda environment using the provided environment.yaml file. You can do this by running `conda env create --file environment.yaml.`

It is recommended that you simply run the notebook file and look at the outputs from the functions there.

However, you can also can run the main.py script using `python main.py`. This will run the script and generate all the tables and plots.

As a last resot you, should everything else fail for some reason, if you have docker and docker compose installed you can run the script by using `docker compose up --build`. The script should then run for you and give you all the outputs.
